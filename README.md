# Pulse: A Real-Time Nightlife Discovery Platform

## Project Overview

**Project Lead:** Davis Kolakowski

## Executive Summary

Pulse is a cutting-edge, location-based platform that revolutionizes how users discover and engage with local nightlife venues. By leveraging real-time data, community-sourced "vibe checks," and AI-driven recommendations, Pulse helps users find the perfect venue based on what's happening right now.

## The Problem

Traditional review and discovery platforms (Yelp, Google Maps, etc.) offer static information that quickly becomes outdated and fails to capture what's happening right now:

- Users can't determine current crowd levels, ambiance, or special events in real-time
- Venues have no effective way to broadcast last-minute events, extended happy hours, or current atmosphere
- A venue's online reputation might not reflect tonight's experience
- Users often make decisions based on outdated information, leading to disappointing experiences

The ambiance of a venue can make or break your night, and traditional apps can't capture the current vibe. The result? Frustration, FOMO, and wasted time and money.

## Target Users

1. **Consumers (21+):**
    - Night-crawlers and social explorers
    - Foodies and drink enthusiasts
    - Live music and entertainment seekers
    - Young professionals looking for quality social experiences
2. **Venues:**
    - Small independent bars and restaurants
    - Caf√©s and lounges
    - Live music venues
    - Any establishment looking to increase foot traffic and engagement

## Core Value Propositions

### For Users:

- Real-time insight into venue atmosphere and crowd levels
- Community-sourced "vibe checks" providing authentic snapshots

- Real-time broadcasting of events, specials, and atmosphere changes
- Analytics on user engagement and conversion
- Community building and loyalty development
- Cost-effective marketing that drives immediate results

## MVP Feature Set

For our initial release, we're focusing on delivering these essential features:

### User Features:

1. **Privacy-First Location System:**
    - Manual address entry as the default option
    - Search around a specific address with adjustable radius settings
    - Opt-in "Use My Current Location" button for users who choose to enable location services
    - No automatic location tracking or GPS permissions required by default
    - City/neighborhood selection for broader area discovery

2. **Real-Time Venue Discovery:**

3. **Three-Category Classification System:**
    - Three distinct categorization elements to improve user discovery:
      - **Venue Types**: Fixed categories for venues (bar, restaurant, cafe, etc.)
      - **Tags**: Event/promotion identifiers with # symbol for specials (#happyhour, #margaritanight, etc.)
      - **Vibes**: User-generated atmosphere descriptors with # symbol (#busy, #livemusic, etc.)
    - Each category serves a specific purpose in the discovery experience
    - Clear visual distinction between Types, Tags, and Vibes in the UI
    - Search and filter functionality specific to each category type

4. **Special-Driven Connections:**
    - Specials serve as the primary link between venues and users
    - Each special includes:
      - Description (e.g., "Half-Price Wings Happy Hour")
      - Type categorization (Food, Drink, Entertainment)
      - Timing details (start time, end time, expiration)
      - Recurrence pattern for regular events
      - Associated venue information
      - Tags for discovery (#wingsnight, #happyhour, etc.)
    - Users discover venues primarily through interesting specials
    - Active specials appear in search results with their Tags
    - Users can follow Tags to receive notifications about matching specials
    - Special verification through user activity threads
    - Time-sensitive nature creates urgency and real-time engagement

5. **Category-Specific Implementation:**
    - **Venue Types**: Selected by venue owners from a predefined list
      - Examples: Bar, Restaurant, Cafe, Lounge, Club, Brewery, Concert Venue
      - Each venue must select a primary Type and can add up to two secondary Types
      - Types are used for basic venue categorization and filtering
      - Displayed prominently on venue profiles and search results
    - **Tags**: Applied to specials for discovery and promotion
      - Examples: #happyhour, #wingsnight, #liveband, #djset, #karaoke
      - Tags are preceded by # symbol for visual distinction
      - Connect users with specific experiences they're seeking
      - Can be followed, searched, and filtered
    - **Vibes**: Created by users to describe current venue conditions
      - Examples: #busy, #quiet, #greatservice, #goodvibes, #nocover
      - Also preceded by # symbol for visual consistency with Tags
      - Help other users know what to expect right now
      - Temporary and tied to the 15-minute expiration of user posts

6. **Live Venue Activity Threads:**
    - Social media-style comment threads attached to each venue
    - Users can post text comments, photos, and short video clips about their current experience
    - All user posts automatically vanish after 15 minutes to ensure information is always current
    - Users can add Vibes to their posts describing the current atmosphere
    - Venue cards show the number of active posts in the thread

        - [Photo of current crowd or performance] "#packed #goodvibes"
        - [10-second video clip of venue atmosphere] "#liveband #jazznight"

7. **Category-Based Discovery System:**
    - Users can browse venues through a multi-faceted approach:
      - By Venue Type (find all bars, restaurants, clubs, etc.)
      - By Tags (find all venues with #happyhour, #livemusic, etc.)
      - By current Vibes (find venues currently #packed, #mellow, etc.)
    - Filter results by combining categories:
      - Type + Tag (e.g., Bars with #happyhour)
      - Type + Vibe (e.g., Restaurants that are currently #quiet)
      - Tag + Vibe (e.g., #livemusic venues that are #energetic)

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend:

- Progressive Web App (PWA) built with **React**, using **Vite** as the build tool for fast development and optimized production builds.
  - Installable on mobile devices
  - Offline capabilities
  - Push notifications (with user permission)
  - Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Written in **TypeScript** for improved code quality and developer experience.
- State management handled by **Redux**, providing a predictable state container.
- User interface components from **MUI (Material-UI)**, implementing Material Design for a consistent and modern look.
- Future native mobile applications planned post-MVP (iOS & Android).
- Web portal for venue management.

### Backend:

- .NET Core (C#) API services
- PostgreSQL database for data storage and initial recommendation engine
- Real-time messaging infrastructure for instant updates
- **Auth0** integration for authentication and authorization services
  - Secure user registration and login
  - Social login options (Google, Facebook, etc.)
  - JWT token-based authentication
  - Role-based access control for users, venues, and administrators
  - Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities
- Content expiration system for managing ephemeral posts
- Category indexing and search optimization
- Special scheduling and recurrence handling

### Identity and Authentication:

- **Auth0 as Identity Provider:**
  - Centralized user authentication and management using Auth0's identity platform.
  - Secure credential storage and handling.
  - Support for multi-factor authentication.
  - User profile management.
  - Compliance with security best practices.
  - Venue owner verification workflows.
  - Role assignment and management (users, venue owners, administrators).
  - Integration with frontend and backend services via OAuth/OpenID Connect.
  - User session management and token handling.

### Authentication & Authorization Model:

The application uses a two-tiered approach to user permissions:

- **Application-Level Authorization (via Auth0):**
  - **System Administrator**: Full access to all application features
    - All venue management capabilities
    - User administration
    - System configuration
    - Content moderation
    - Analytics access
  - **Venue Manager**: Access to manage venues through the global system
    - Create and manage venue information
    - Create specials for their venues
    - View analytics for their venues
    - Limited user management for their venues
  - **Application User**: Basic authenticated user permissions
    - Create posts about venues
    - View venues and specials
    - Delete their own posts
    - Follow tags and receive notifications

- **Venue-Specific Authorization (Database-Level):**
  - **manage:venue**: Edit venue details, hours, and basic information
  - **manage:specials**: Create and manage special offers and events
  - **respond:posts**: Respond to customer posts about the venue
  - **invite:users**: Add other users as venue managers
  - **manage:users**: Control permissions for venue users

This hybrid approach allows granular control over which users can manage specific venues, independent of their global application roles.

### Database Schema:

- **Venues**: Basic venue information, location data, primary and secondary Types
- **VenueTypes**: Predefined list of venue classifications (bar, restaurant, cafe, etc.)
- **OperatingSchedule**: Venue business hours and days of operation
- **Specials**: Event details, timing, recurrence, venue association (maintains existing SpecialTypes enum)
- **Tags**: Tag definitions for specials
- **TagToSpecialLink**: Associations between Tags and Specials
- **Posts**: Ephemeral user content with 15-minute expiration, includes foreign keys to user and venue
- **Vibes**: User-created atmosphere descriptors
- **VibeToPostLink**: Associations between Vibes and Posts
- **VenuePermission**: Permissions that can be granted to users for specific venues
- **VenueUser**: Associates users with venues they can manage
- **VenueUserToPermissionLink**: Links venue users with specific permissions
- **ApplicationUser**: User account data and application-specific information
  - Id: Auto-incrementing primary key in our database
  - Auth0Id: Auth0 identifier for linking to external identity provider
  - Account creation and last login timestamps
  - Default location and search radius preferences
  - Location services opt-in status
  - Profile status (active/inactive)
  - Note: Basic profile info (name, email, profile picture) managed by Auth0

### Infrastructure:
